     @brief
          The main file for bike firmware. This includes
          Main.h which in turn interconnects all files
          and allows for access to the global variables.
          These variables are then passed along to all other files as
          pointers. Then it runs the setup methods for all those
          files and then it sets up RTOS to run all the different files
          as individual tasks. These tasks are: datalogging,
          display, precharge, CAN, idle. These tasks will be further
          described in the documentation for their individual files.

    Main. The source for the entire firmware. Utilizes Arduino's framework
    with void setup() and void loop() methods, but only void setup() is used.
    Before the void setup(), Main.h is included into the file which in turn
    interconnects all files and allows for access to the global variables.
    These variables are what is eventually used in setup() and all the
    helper methods, being passed along to all other files/tasks
    as pointers, allowing for them to updated and accessed at the same time.
    If Can.ino updates the motorTemperature, Display.ino has
    an updated value for the motorTemperature. Then the void setup will execute
    everything and also act as the loop. That is because the setup calls on the
    xTaskCreate() method from the RTOS library and then the vTaskStartScheduler()
    method which in turn abstracts everything from us and rotates between
    all the tasks updating them and transferring resources as required. As of now,
    tasks operate on different resources than each other, thus there is no
    need for semaphores, however, if that is changed in the future, there
    is an example line of creating a semaphore above the calls to the
    xTaskCreate() method. The breakdown of how these methods and variables
    work in detail are explained further in the documentation closer for
    those methods and variables specifically. Please make sure to read
    and understand everything before you make any changes to this firmware.

    \note
      As of 3/1/2023, I think this firmware is fully race-ready and meeting
      all requirements to race. Ideally, I would use HIL and their CAN interface
      to further test the requirements and ensure proper performance under race-communication
      circumstances, but I'm just tired, you guys can do that while testing
      everything else next quarter. As of now, my goal is to create full documentation
      for this codebase and train up all members to be able to use it without any trouble.

    \todo
      Refine further.
      \n \n
      Look for redundant variables, pins, etc and remove.
      \n \n
      Change the name of preCharge. It's not just preCharge now, I personally like the name
      "controls.ino" and "controls.h". Make sure you change the #includes as well if you do that.
      Please Please change "preCharge" or whatever it's called to not use this many global/struct
      variables. It doesn't need everything globalized, it can pass them as parameters and eventually
      output to global variables *preCharge.angle_X and *preCharge.angle_Y.
