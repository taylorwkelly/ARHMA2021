     @brief
          The main config file for bike firmware. This initializes
          all variables that are passed along to all other files as
          pointers. Then it creates the initial reference (there's a proper
          C programming term for it) for all the methods used in Main.ino.
          This file exists as an overall configuration for the
          bike firmware as all these variables can be changed to meet
          requirements. Like all other header files, it exists
          as the skeleton on which the .ino file is built.

    This file exists as an overall configuration for the
    bike firmware as all these variables can be changed to meet
    requirements. Like all other header files, it exists
    as the skeleton on which the .ino file is built.

    \note
      Main thing to note. The statement #pragma once is a compiler specific command for newer compilers in C.
      It is the equivalent of ifndef define statements. If you dont know what those are, please take CSE 351.
      To give the gist of it, you need a #pragma once or ifndef statment (in our older code) to ensure
      that when running the code, when you do a #include Main.h and if every other file does that,
      the #pragma once command ensures that the first time the Main.h is #included, it is properly
      defined, so that when a file attempts to include it again, it skips that including.
      If that doesn't make sense, dont worry, CSE 351, CSE 374. Please take them. They're
      like top 6 EE classes.
      Secondly, in this file all variables are static because the static keyword in C++
      (which is what .ino files are technically speaking) is basically used
      to define global variables that are not to be removed in memory. All the variables
      below are the skeleton of the firmware, every file references to these variables
      by being passed their address and changing their value using that address.
      Instead of creating 10 copies when passing variables around, there's just
      one global copy.
      ALSO, if you are looking to change configurations for the overall
      firmware this is the place to do it. Changing the number of CAN devices connected,
      the Screen type used, etc. All can be done from here.

    \todo
      Based on refinements made for preCharge/controls.ino, remove spare and redundant variables. And just generally ALL the spare variables.
      \n \n
      Based on the changes implemented for SoC, I would add another variable for the low-voltage
      current sneors or any other current sensors you add
      \n \n
      CHANGE THE NUM_THERMI based on the number of thermistors that Powertain settles on.
      \n \n
      Final Goal.

/**
   \note
   setup() calls on all the helper methods in Main.ino. These helper methods serve
   to initialize all pin modes, package all variables from Main.h into structs, initialize
   all communication protocols (as of now, just I2C), and then use those packaged structs to
   call on the RTOS xTaskCreate() to  then send the variables off to various tasks with no issues.
   xTaskCreate() takes in a function name (pointer to an existing function which contains the essence
   of the task (these exist in the different files)), a label (string), stack size (integer/number),
   the parameters required for that task (a void pointer to the packaged structs from before)
   and lastly a task priority. There's another variable but it's kinda useless for our case
   and is only discussed in the detailed discussion below. \n \n

   Taking from the FreeRTOS documentation, the parameters serve the following DETAILED purposes.
   \n \n
   pvTaskCode aka the pointer to the function used for the task. This function is usually
   an infinite loop with an RTOS VTaskDelay() call which will be further elaborated on within
   those functions in the documentation.
   \n \n
   pcName aka the string with the funciton name. This is ususally used for debugging purposes.
   usStackDepth is the number of words to allocate for the task's stack (for those of you who havent
   had a chance to take CSE 374 or CSE 351, stack is dynamic memory, thus if any of your tasks
   use a lot of parameters or perform recursion, the stack size might have to be increased).
   Display has often been a victim of the stack size being too small in the past.
   \n \n
   pvParameters aka the void pointer to the struct composed of the variables declared in Main.h.
   Just a simple void pointer which is passed to the task when it executes.
   While passing variables and being careful with memory leaks is not too much of a concern
   thanks to the Arduino framework, it is still important to use good practices
   like this void pointer task memory unit to avoid any issues (plus RTOS just requires something
   to be passed through anyway).
   \n \n
   uxPriority aka the priority at which the task will execute. Lower priority numbers indicate
   tasks with lower priority in execution. That is, while the RTOS is constantly swapping between
   your tasks, ensuring they execute properly, etc the higher priority tasks are given highest
   priority to run once the CPU is ready. Just makes sense really.
   \n \n
   pxCreatedTask is a variable that is used to pass a handle to the created task outside of the
   xTaskCreate() function. That means the ??? IDK it's not needed.

   to canTask(). canTask() updates the variable which in turn updates it for everything, allowing display to be updated
   with no problem (since all variables used by tasks are just pointers to the original variable that is declared
   in Main.h and then updating one just updates everything across the board.
